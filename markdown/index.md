## Hello##

I&#39;m a self-motivated backend/devops-focused coder, trained as an engineer, with 8 years experience in the heavily regulated healthcare industry. I love staying up to date on the latest technologies, best practices and trends, especially in the areas of distributed architectures, automated everything, and scalability. I&#39;ve designed and developed multiple systems from the ground up.

I spent many years as the sole developer for my projects, but I thrive in collaborative environments, and am now supervising other developers. My current preferred language is Node.js, but I enjoy picking up new languages, and have recently been experimenting with Go.

I&#39;ve love the *community* aspect of open-source, from consuming vast quantities of podcasts, to attending events and conferences, to using github to clean up or rewrite various open-source tools I use.
